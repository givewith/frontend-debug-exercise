# Givewith Frontend Debugging Exercise

The purpose of this repo is to assess the ability of candidates to debug basic JavaScript/React issues, as well as add some basic UI functionality.

The app will not render properly initially. The first task is to figure out why.

The next task is to figure out why no images are rendered when the "Render images" button is clicked.

Next we'll want to address any issues flagged in the console (hint: you may want to rework the IMAGE_URLS structure).

Finally, let's add some CSS so it looks a little nicer, and see if we can hide the "Render images" button after it's clicked.
